# Book Club - Rails APP

This app is designed to assist a book club with keeping in touch remotely.  Users can create an account, log in, create "libraries" which are collections of books that fit into categories of their choosing, rate those libraries, and list how many times they have read each book in their library.  They can also look at everyone else's library and find lists of libraries that contain certain books.
